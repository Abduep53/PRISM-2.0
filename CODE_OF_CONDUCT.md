- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account

- Contributing code, documentation, or other work to the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **prism-conduct@example.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
