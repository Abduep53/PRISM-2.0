## 🎯 Project Overview

PRISM is a novel framework for privacy-preserving human action recognition that integrates ε-differential privacy with spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs). The project addresses the critical privacy-utility tradeoff in pose-based action recognition by providing provable privacy guarantees while maintaining competitive classification performance.

### Key Features

- **🔒 Differential Privacy**: Provable ε-differential privacy guarantees using DP-SGD
- **🧠 Spatial-Temporal Graph Networks**: Advanced ST-GCN architecture for pose sequence analysis
- **⚡ Kinematic Feature Extraction**: Dimensionality reduction while preserving movement semantics
- **📊 Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Rigorous evaluation across multiple performance metrics
- **🚀 Model Optimization**: Post-training quantization and TorchScript export for deployment
- **🏥 Real-World Ready**: Designed for sensitive applications like healthcare and clinical diagnostics

### Scientific Contributions

1. **First Application** of differential privacy to spatial-temporal graph networks for action recognition
2. **Novel Kinematic Pipeline** that reduces data dimensionality while preserving movement semantics
3. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework** demonstrating privacy-utility tradeoffs
4. **Open-Source Implementation** enabling reproducible research and practical deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

###  Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/prism.git
cd prism
```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv prism_env
source prism_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: prism_env\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Data Processing
```python
from data_pipeline import extract_and_normalize_pose_with_kinematics, PRISMDataset

# Extract pose and kinematic features from video
pose_data, kinematic_features = extract_and_normalize_pose_with_kinematics("path/to/video.mp4")

# Create dataset
dataset = PRISMDataset("data/", use_kinematics=True, sequence_length=30)
```

#### 2. Model Training
```python
from models import STGCN_PRISM
from privacy_module import PrivacyPreservingTrainer, create_privacy_config

# Create model
model = STGCN_PRISM(num_joints=33, in_channels=4, num_classes=101)

# Configure privacy
privacy_config = create_privacy_config(epsilon=1.0, delta=1e-5)

# Train with privacy
trainer = PrivacyPreservingTrainer(model, privacy_config)
results = trainer.train(train_loader, val_loader, num_epochs=50)
```

#### 3. Model Evaluation
```python
from benchmarks import run_comprehensive_benchmark

# Run complete benchmark
benchmark_results = run_comprehensive_benchmark(
    lstm_model, stgcn_model, dp_model, test_loader,
    privacy_epsilon=1.0, privacy_delta=1e-5

from optimization import optimize_stgcn_model

# Optimize and export model
optimization_results = optimize_stgcn_model(
    stgcn_model, calibration_data, test_loader,
    model_name="PRISM_optimized"
)
```
